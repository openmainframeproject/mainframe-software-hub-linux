# Mainframe Software Hub for Linux

Welcome to the Mainframe Software Hub for Linux. Here you can look for open source packages not available in distribution repositories or community-provided packages.

## Purpose

Currently software artifacts provided by opensource communities typically target `x86` architecture. This project aims to augment that by providing artifacts for `s390x` architecture. Artifacts in this context refers to anything that is produced for consumption by the CI/CD system in place for the particular opensource project. This can include binaries, RPMs, DEBs, and container images.

## Build

A subset of build scripts are provided [here](https://github.com/linux-on-ibm-z/scripts) to build select projects. Any build system can be used to generate corresponding artifacts.
